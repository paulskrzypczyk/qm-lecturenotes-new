## Preface

Welcome to the quantum mechanics section of the 2nd year core physics unit (From Classical to Modern Physics). In this part of the course we will investigate the quantum description of a particle moving in one and three dimensions. This is the quantum description of **mechanics** and is usually referred to as **quantum mechanics**. 

This material will build upon the quantum physics material you learnt in the first year course physics unit (Classical, Quantum and Thermal Physics). I have provided a [brief recap video](recap.md) but will not repeat the content from that unit here. You should **refer back to the lecture notes for that course** where needed.

Similarly, we will make use of the **probability and statistics** that you learnt as part of the **First Year Physics Laboratory**. You also hould refer back to the content on Blackboard where needed. 

## Flipped-classroom

I will be teaching this unit using a [Flipped Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) approach. In this approach the **lecture content** is delivered via **pre-recorded videos** which you should watch as part of your **independent study**. These videos **closely follow** the lecture notes, and you can find links directly to the videos embedded in these notes, so that it should be very easy to use the two in conjunction. 

Each week we will then have **extended (two-hour) problem classes**. Each class will only be attended by half of the cohort, so that there will be more time for interaction with myself and the teaching assistant. In these classes, I will set **unseen problems** which will apply ideas and concepts from the lecture material, and put it into context. You are encouraged to work in **small groups**, and I will go over the solutions to the problems in real time. You will then find a longer and more challenging set of **problems** to attempt as the remainder of your independent study. I provide the **answers** to these problems (the bottom line of the solution), so that you can check if you've got the right answer. The full solutions will be released a week later. 
```{aside}
*I have seen that many students find it useful to have the answers up front, so that you will know when you have the right answer (although this doesn't necessarily mean that your solution will be correct!). As you mature as physicists, you should learn **not to need this**. That is, you should try to become less reliant on having access to answers, and this is a good way of checking that you are becoming a more mature learner. In reality, when we get to the problems that really count (i.e. in a job, or in research), there won't necessarily answers available, and so it is important to find methods to gain confidence in an answer. This is part of your general education in this degree.*
```
I have been employing a flipped-classroom approach now for a number of years. I perceive many advantages to this methodology, over the more traditional methodology. These include

- You have the ability to learn new content **at a time and pace that suits you**. While it is your responsibility to watch the videos (or not), you choose when to do so, and have the ability to stop and pause and think, if you so wish (you can even watch at up to 2x speed if you wish!). None of this is possible in a traditional lecture. 
- Content can be more naturally divided up into topics, and doesn't have to be delivered 50 minutes at a time, often with the material at the end of a lecture becoming rushed.
- While there can be a risk of falling behind, it is in principle easy to catch up.
- This opens up more time for additional problem classes, with more interaction with your peers and myself and the teaching assistant. 

As with any method of teaching, there is always a trade-off. Responding to common criticisms up front:

- Lack of structure: Some students find it very helpful having scheduled lectures, and find the lack of structure in a flipped approach challenging. I strongly encourage you to keep to the weekly structure, and attend the problem classes, as these can be key to learning this material. If you need structure then **design your own**: schedule those times when you will watch the videos. Add these to your calendar, and don't allow yourself to miss them (even if you have other deadlines). 
- Inability to ask questions: Students do ask questions during lectures, and so by having the content delivered via videos, this is no longer possible. If you have questions, **please make a note of them** and bring them to the problem classes, or email me. I definitely don't want to discourage questions, and I find that I have **more time** to answer your questions using a flipped approach, compared to a traditional lecture. It can also be the case that the ability to stop, pause, and think can help you answer your own questions, which is another one of the key skills we are aiming to teach you during your degree. 

## Textbooks 

While I am providing a set of lecture notes to accompany the course, **I want to encourage you to read beyond these notes, and consult other textbooks**. In particular, you can find a list of recommended textbooks in the University's [Resources List](https://rl.talis.com/3/bristol/lists/5F59CD9C-601C-E8BB-DF76-E2B8AA114FFE.html?lang=en-GB).

## Questions and comments

If you have any questions about the course, or anything above, please don't hesitate to contact me, either by email (paul.skrzypczyk@bristol.ac.uk) or in a problem class. 

Finally, this course has been extensively updated this year, with the lecture notes largely rewritten. If you find any **errors** or **mistakes** or something which isn't clear, please let me know, or fill in this anonymous form:
