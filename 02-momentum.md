In the previous chapter we begin our investigation of the quantum mechanics of a particle moving in one dimension, focusing on the **position** of the particle. Here we will continue our development, by now considering how **momentum** is described quantum mechanically. We will see in this chapter that momentum is related to **wave-like** properties of a particle. 

We will introduce the **momentum wavefunction** $\tilde{\psi}(p)$, (in analogy to the spatial wavefunction $\psi(x)$), and give the relationship to the latter, and also introduce the **momentum operator** $\hat{P}$ and its associated operator $\op{P}$ (that acts upon wavefunctions $\psi(x)$). 

## The De Broglie relation and states of definite momentum

Our starting point for understanding the momentum of a quantum particle will in fact be the famous **de Broglie** relationship, which stated that if a particle had a momentum $p$, then it had a wavelength of $\lambda$ equal to
```{math}
:label: e-de-Broglie
\lambda = \frac{h}{p},
```
where $h$ is **Planck's constant**. While this formula is part of '*old quantum theory*' it turns out that the basic insight is ultimately correct. More concretely, what is correct in quantum mechanics is 
>  A quantum particle with definite momentum $p$ has a wavefunction with a definite wavelength $\lambda = h/p$. 

What is a wavefunction with a definite wavelength $\lambda$? This could potentially mean a couple of things, for example $\cos(2\pi x/\lambda)$ or $\sin(2\pi x/\lambda)$? These are both examples of plane waves of wavelength $\lambda$. Neither of these happen to be the correct answer. What we actually mean is a **complex plane wave** 
```{math}
:label: e-complex-plane-wave
Ae^{2\pi i x / \lambda}
``` 
where $A$ is the amplitude (which we take to be real out of convenience for the moment, and will come back to shortly). This is depicted in the following:

**Complex plane waves** 3 different ways of representing a visually representing a complex plane wave. (a) A plot of the real and imaginary parts of the function. We have $\mathrm{Re}(Ae^{2\pi i x/\lambda}) = A\cos (2\pi x/\lambda)$ and $\mathrm{Im}(Ae^{2\pi i x/\lambda}) = A\sin (2\pi x/\lambda)$. (b) A 3-D plot of this function, with the real and imaginary parts plotted along two orthgonal directions. In this representation, we see that a complex plane wave corresponds to a helix. (c) Polar representation of the function, where the phase is represented by colour. In this representation we have a stripy constant line. 
```

If we substitute the de Broglie relation [](#e-de-Broglie) into [](#e-complex-plane-wave), then we see that
```{math}
Ae^{2\pi i x/\lambda} = Ae^{2\pi i p x/h} = A e^{ipx/\hbar},
```
where
````{card}
```{math}
\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi},
```
````
is the so-called **reduced Planck constant** or simply '**h-bar**' for short. 

Putting everything together, in quantum mechanics, **particles that have a definite momentum $p$ have wavefunctions $v_p(x)$ given by
````{card}
```{math}
v_p(x) = A e^{ipx/\hbar},
```
````
corresponding to **complex plane waves** of wavelength $\lambda = h/p$. We will take this essentially as a **postulate**, and not attempt to derive this. 

Using [](#e-general-quantum-state), i.e. the general relationship between a quantum state and a wavefunction, this means we can **directly write down** quantum states of definite momentum, which we will denote by $\ket{p}$ and refer to as `momentum states' (in analogy to our notation $\ket{x}$ for position states). These are
```{math}
\ket{p} = \infint v_p(x) \ket{x} dx = A\infint e^{ipx/\hbar} \ket{x} dx.
```
We still have some ambiguity here: we haven't specified what the `amplitude' $A$ should be. We can fix this by analogy to position states. Recall that in [](#e-position-norm) we normalised position states using the Dirac delta function. Here, we will demand that momentum states satisfy the same normalisation condition:
````{card}
```{math}
:label: e-momentum-norm
\langle p' | p \rangle = \delta(p-p').
```
````
As an exercise, you will show that this fixes $A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}$. We thus have
````{card}
```{math}
:label: e-momentum-eigenstate
\ket{p} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}\infint e^{ipx/\hbar} \ket{x} dx
```
````
are **quantum states of definite momentum**. 

Note that due to [](#e-momentum-norm), states of definite momentum have **infinite normalisation** (just like states of definite position). What this means is that they are, once again, **unphysical states**! We thus have another profound conclusion:
> It is physically impossible in quantum mechanics for a particle to have a definite momentum.

We can understand this from a second perspective. Our requirement to have a definite wavelength means that a particle has to be spread out **everywhere**. If this were possible, then what would be probability density $p(x)$ to find the particle at some location $x$? This would be
```{math}
\vph p(x) = |v_p(x)|^2 &= \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}e^{ipx/\hbar}\right|^2, \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}e^{-ipx/\hbar}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}e^{ipx/\hbar}, \\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi \hbar}.
```
This is a **uniform** probability density â€” we are equally likely to find the particle anywhere. If we then ask what is the **total** probability to find the particle anywhere, we see that
```{math}
\infint p(x) dx = \infint \frac{1}{2\pi \hbar} dx = \infty. 
```
This is an unphysical result. Furthermore, we can't even 'fix' it, by changing our normalisation, since **any** non-zero choice of normalisation will lead to the same conclusion. We therefore see that it must be physically impossible to have a particle whose wavefunction is a (complex) plane wave, and therefore it is physically impossible to have a definite momentum. 

Nevertheless, just as it is extremely **useful** to use position states $\ket{x}$, it is similarly useful to use the momentum states $\ket{p}$, even though they aren't valid quantum states. 

## The momentum operator

One use of the states $\ket{p}$ is that they allow us to define the **momentum operator** $\hat{P}$. Recall that, **by definition**, this is the operator for which the momentum states $\ket{p}$ are **eigenstates**, with corresponding momentum eigenvalue $p$, 
````{card}
```{math}
\hat{P}\ket{p} = p\ket{p}.
```
````
We will return to the momentum operator shortly, and find its associated operator $\op{P}$. Before doing so, we will first introduce the **momentum wavefunction**.

## The momentum wavefunction

Just as we can write any quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ as a **superposition of position states** $\ket{x}$ using the **spatial wavefunction** \psi(x)$, we can also write it as a **superposition of momentum states** $\ket{p}$, 
````{card}
```{math}
\ket{\psi} = \infint \tilde{\psi}(p) \ket{p} dp,
```
````
where $\tilde{\psi}(p)$ is called the **momentum wavefunction**. 
```{aside}
We will typically refer to $\psi(x)$ as just 'the wavefunction' since it is the wavefunction we will spend the majority of our time studying. When it is important to be clear, we will refer to it more precisely as the 'spatial wavefunction'. Similarly, we will mostly refer to $\tilde{\psi}(p)$ as the 'momentum wavefunction'. If it is clear from context, we will also just refer to this as the wavefunction. $\ket{x}$ and $\ket{p}$ are two different (continuous!) bases, and the wavefunctions are just the coefficients of the quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ in these two different bases. 
```
Just as we saw in [](#e-norm-wavefunction), the normalisation of the quantum state, $\| \ket{\psi} \| = 1$ implies that
```{math}
\infint |\tilde{\psi}(p)|^2 = 1.
```
We also know that this is related to the normalisation of **momentum measurements**. In particular, if we were to **measure the momentum of a quantum particle** (i.e. measure $\hat{P}$), then the **probability density** to obtain the outcome $p$ is
````{card}
```{math}
p(p) = |\tilde{\psi}(p)|^2
```
````
However, just as we saw that idealised position measurements are impossible, **so too are ideal momentum measurements**. These would need to have infinite resolution, which is impossible. In reality, we can also only perform **coarse-grained** momentum measurements, determining the momentum of the particle up to some level of precision. Nevertheless, it is very instructive to consider the momentum probability density $p(p) = |\tilde{\psi}(p)|^2$ that would arise from such idealised measurements.
